# Celine

Celine is a minimal, local AI assistant that runs entirely on your own
machine through [Ollama](https://ollama.com). She chats in the terminal,
keeps the conversation in memory, and calls tools through a fixed, safe
tool-calling architecture — currently the current time plus opening and
controlling a small allowlist of Windows applications.

## Current milestone

**Milestone 4.2 — safe window control.**
Celine can open a fixed allowlist of desktop applications and can minimise,
restore, focus, or gracefully close their visible top-level windows. The
approved applications are `notepad`, `calculator`, `word`, and
`file_explorer`. Executable paths and window-matching rules are hardcoded;
window titles, regular expressions, process IDs, and handles never come from
model input.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed and running locally
- The model pulled: `ollama pull qwen3:4b-instruct`

## Installation

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run Celine

```powershell
python run.py
```

Type your message and press Enter. Type `exit` or `quit` (or press
`Ctrl+C`) to close.

## Performance logging (optional, off by default)

To see where latency comes from, edit `src/celine/core/config.py`:

```python
PERF_LOG = True
```

Run Celine normally. Each request then prints concise timings (no model
reasoning is ever printed):

```
[perf] ollama_call_1=6.42s
[perf] tool:get_current_time=0.001s
[perf] ollama_call_2=4.87s
[perf] total=11.31s ollama_calls=2 tool_calls=1
```

A plain chat shows a single Ollama call:

```
[perf] ollama_call_1=6.08s
[perf] total=6.09s ollama_calls=1 tool_calls=0
```

Set `PERF_LOG = False` again to turn it off.

Tool debug logging works the same way: set `TOOL_LOG = True` to print
`[tool] open_application ...` request/result lines (never model
reasoning).

## Current architecture

```
src/celine/
  __init__.py
  main.py              # terminal entry point: input loop, shutdown
  core/
    config.py          # OLLAMA_URL, MODEL, MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS, PERF_LOG, ...
    prompts.py         # system prompt (personality vs capability rules)
    assistant.py       # history + tool-round orchestration (no HTTP)
    perf.py            # optional [perf] timing instrumentation
  llm/
    ollama_client.py   # the only module that talks to Ollama
  tools/
    system_time.py     # get_current_time implementation
    windows_apps.py    # open_application allowlist + launcher (no shell)
    window_control.py  # fixed matching + approved window actions
    registry.py        # fixed whitelist, schemas, validation
tests/
  test_tool_registry.py
  test_assistant.py
  test_perf.py
  test_open_application.py
  test_window_control.py
run.py                 # launcher: puts src/ on the path, starts main
pytest.ini             # test config (src/ on path, tests/ folder)
```

### Execution flow

1. `run.py` starts `main.main()` (src/ on `sys.path`).
2. `main.py` builds an `Assistant(chat=ollama_client.chat)` and loops on
   user input.
3. `assistant.py` appends the user message, calls the model, and — if the
   model requests a tool — validates and runs it via `registry.py`,
   appends a `role: "tool"` result, and calls the model again
   (up to `MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS`).
4. `ollama_client.py` is the only place that performs HTTP (`/api/chat`),
   translating failures into simple, named exceptions.
5. `main.py` prints Celine's reply or a friendly error.

## Current capabilities

- Local chat with `qwen3:4b-instruct` via Ollama's `/api/chat`
- In-memory conversation history (per session)
- Native tool calling with a fixed whitelist registry
- Three tools: `get_current_time()` (no arguments),
  `open_application(name)`, and
  `control_window(application, action)`
- The application allowlist is `notepad`, `calculator`, `word`, and
  `file_explorer`
- Approved window actions are `minimize`, `restore`, `focus`, and `close`;
  close posts a normal window-close request rather than killing a process
- App names are trimmed/lowercased and alias-mapped; anything outside
  the allowlist (arbitrary strings, paths, commands) is rejected
- Unknown tools rejected safely; tool arguments validated
- `MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS` prevents infinite tool loops
- Automated tests that need no running Ollama server (`pytest`)

## Current limitations

- Window control applies only to visible top-level windows matched by fixed,
  code-owned rules for the four approved applications
- No typing, clicking, keyboard/mouse automation, screenshots, or control of
  arbitrary/unapproved windows
- No arbitrary titles, regular expressions, process IDs, or window handles
- No process termination or force-killing
- No file access, shell/PowerShell execution, or web search
- No voice, persistent memory, or database
- Chat history is lost when the program exits
- Privacy: the current chat runs locally through Ollama, but Celine
  describes privacy based on active capabilities — future internet-using
  tools (e.g. web search) would change that picture
